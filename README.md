# ATELIWARE - Engineering Tech Assessment
Géfersom Bejos, CEO of the large Brazilian e-commerce company <b>amazônia</b>, hired ateliware to develop a new system responsible for <b>calculating the fastest delivery route for his new drone system.</b>

Once the starting point, the object collection point, and the delivery point are defined, <b> his drones should, in the shortest time possible, reach their destination.</b>

Amazon is already a technology company, so it will be providing a service by which it is possible to find out the time needed to move between segments.

## The challenge:

The challenge is based on building, within 1 week, <b>a modern web application, in any development technology</b> (Python/Django, express.js + React, PHP/Laravel, anything!) that allows the user to inform the drone's origin position, the object pickup position and the delivery destination.

All these positions should be informed as if they were coordinates of a chessboard by letters on the horizontal axis (A to H) and numbers on the vertical axis (1 to 8).

## The Solution:

I built this solution using C# and .NET Core on the backend, while on the frontend, I created a simple .html file with Vue 3 framework imported via CDN.

I hosted both solutions on Azure, link below:
